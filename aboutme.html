        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>“Why are you not do homework!? No homework, no dinner!” No, this is not a Jimmy O. Yang skit. It’s my dad on a Friday night, barging into my room as I load into a game with the boys. My dad is the embodiment of the stereotypical Asian father, always pushing me to excel academically. But to me, my dad's push felt like a shove and became a source of tension in our relationship</p>
        <p>This tension resulted in a number of heated arguments that left us both upset at each other. Often, I would seek validation from my uncle who seemed to better understand my academic struggles. Through these conversations, I learned that my dad had dreams of attending university and becoming an engineer. But with my father being the oldest male sibling and my grandfather being handicapped from the Vietnam War, he had put aside his ambitions to make sure his siblings were able to fulfill their own dreams in their challenging circumstances.</p>
        <p>For a long time, I held his actions against him. However, as I've grown up, I've come to realize how many sacrifices he made so that I could be where I am today. His selfless sacrifices have fueled my ambition and hunger for success. What I always saw as a burden has now become a torch that stokes the flames of my personal motivation.</p>
        <p>Professionally, I hope to break expectations through hard work and dedication just like my dad did. I want to push myself to work my absolute hardest to be the best that I can be. I look forward to the challenges that lie ahead while I strive to make the most of any professional opportunities that come my way.</p>
